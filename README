A Wordpress theme for the 2011 Priceless Campout. Some notes on using it:

Images on Pages: If you add images, size them to Medium and align them
None. That will make a nice image that spans the whole text column. Landscape
photos will look much better, so stick to those.

Menu: is controlled through Navigation -> Menus. You can include any pages you
like and leave the rest out. Reorder, etc.

Right Sidebar: is controlled through Appearance -> Widgets. You can add or
remove any widgets you like, here. In our installation, the Text widget is used
to highlight important information, like the date of this year's event.
